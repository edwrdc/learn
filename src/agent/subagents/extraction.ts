/**
 * The extraction pipeline (vision §1 construction, 2026-09-02 redesign;
 * relinked 2026-09-27) — the sole graph writer. Three stages, one
 * orchestrator (the spine stage came and went, 2026-09-30: serialized
 * digest-aware extraction replaced it — the owner's live test showed
 * the post-hoc assembly pass added complexity without perceptible
 * gain; the extractor itself is the assembler now):
 *
 *   extractor (LLM)  the ONE stage that sees the raw source (a session
 *                    rendered as the teacher's prose — each passage
 *                    labeled with its ACTUAL message id, "TEACHER [id]",
 *                    owner 2026-10-13 — or a notes file verbatim, walked
 *                    in stretches) → submits NEW core ideas + reasoning
 *                    chains (owner redesign, 2026-09-30); a session
 *                    submit additionally carries each proposition's
 *                    messageId — the anchor the merger stamps into the
 *                    node's message-granular provenance (2026-10-13).
 *                    DIGEST-AWARE (2026-09-30 evening):
 *                    when the source already yielded material, the
 *                    prompt carries THE GRAPH SO FAR (that source's
 *                    propositions + chains, ids verbatim) and the
 *                    extractor builds on it — referencing existing ids
 *                    instead of restating, leaning on established
 *                    conclusions as premises. Stretches of one source
 *                    run SERIALLY (each extract reads every earlier
 *                    merge); tree-blind, FULLY TRUSTED — nothing
 *                    downstream re-checks it.
 *   auditor (LLM)    never sees the source. Its job is IDENTITY: for each
 *                    NEW proposition, linkTo an existing graph node or
 *                    create — decided by EXPLORING the graph through
 *                    tools (find / list_sessions / list_propositions),
 *                    not by an injected graph dump (context bloat,
 *                    owner 2026-09-27). Links are its ONLY deliverable
 *                    — it never mints edges (owner 2026-09-28: the
 *                    graph connects across sources solely through
 *                    identified equivalences). Input is PROPOSITIONS
 *                    only — never chains (owner 2026-09-30).
 *   merger (core)    mergeFindings() → deterministic ledger appends +
 *                    chain simplification (2026-09-30 evening: the
 *                    ancestry-cover / prefer-fewest-premises pass that
 *                    strips redundant derivations — core/graph.ts)
 *
 * The events ledger is GONE (2026-09-27): quiz outcomes and understanding
 * observations are no longer formalized in the graph — the graph is purely
 * extracted reasoning chains (nodes + edges).
 *
 * The extractor is a single-tool-call worker (one TypeBox-validated submit
 * call — a pi agent purely so the model can retry a schema-invalid call).
 * The auditor is a small AGENTIC loop: exploration tools plus one submit.
 *
 * Created via createExtractionPipeline(deps) — the composition root
 * (chat-handler) injects the storage ports + models; this module never
 * imports an adapter. runExtraction is single-flight per chat: a second
 * trigger while one run is in flight is a no-op (the next trigger picks up
 * whatever the in-flight run missed). On failure nothing is checkpointed —
 * the next trigger re-runs the whole thing.
 *
 * The FORMAT-AGNOSTIC FRONT DOOR (2026-09-13): importNotes() runs the SAME
 * three stages over raw personal notes (arbitrary format — no chat, no
 * session, no message ids). A notes-mode extractor prompt replaces the
 * session one; the auditor and merger are shared (identity + deterministic
 * appends don't care where text came from). Provenance is the file itself:
 * source ids ("src_" + path hash) play the chatId role in mappings and
 * checkpoints, and the source record (graphStore sources seam) carries
 * the file path + the run's usage.
 *
 * Observability (§5 baseline): every stage logs one line per step, its
 * start, and its duration; the pipeline logs a failure line before
 * rethrowing, so the server log reads start → stage timings → merged
 * stats (or failed) for every run.

source teaches by arguing — ideas worked out from other ideas, down to a foundation the rest stands on.
Your deliverable is twofold: the core ideas themselves, and the chains of reasoning that derive them.
Each chain is premises that JOINTLY entail a conclusion. Entailment is the only link that earns a
chain — where the real connection is historical or narrative (who argued what, how a debate or
exposition unfolds), there is no chain; keep the pieces as bare ideas or drop them. The direction of
the graph is upward: foundational ideas at the bottom, derived ideas above them, each chain showing
how its conclusion follows from what is more established — do not submit connections that carry no
derivation.

The graph holds TRUE ideas about the world, nothing else — never anything about the learner, the
teacher, or this reading: not "the learner understands X" but X. A misconception enters as its TRUE
correction. Each statement is one self-contained idea at full precision.

Extract the load-bearing ideas of the subject — what a reference on it would teach — not the full run
of the discourse. An idea earns its place only when the source's arguments run through it — examples,
notation glosses, and restatements that no argument needs are not core ideas. Every idea must stand
alone for a reader who never saw this source: names and statements may not lean on the source's own
scaffolding (claim numbering, axiom tags, arc labels); a claim that only matters as part of how this
document is organized is not knowledge — drop it.

When the prompt carries THE GRAPH SO FAR, you are continuing a source already partly extracted: build
on it. Reference an existing idea by its id ("n_…") instead of restating it, and prefer chains that
lean on established conclusions as premises — derive new material from what is already derived. Do
not re-derive a conclusion the graph already holds unless the route is genuinely different.

SUBMIT with one submit_findings call: every NEW core idea with a short name and a precise statement,
and every chain as premises + conclusion. A chain's premises and conclusion may be ids from this
submission OR existing ids from THE GRAPH SO FAR, verbatim. Premises within one chain are used
TOGETHER — independent arguments for the same conclusion are separate chains. A conclusion may
reappear, by id, as a premise of later chains. A bare idea that no argument uses rides the
propositions list alone. Include every field even when empty — "chains": [] when the source makes no
arguments. The tool's field descriptions carry the details.`;

const AUDITOR_INSTRUCTIONS = `You are the linking stage of a learning application's extraction pipeline. An extractor
has read a source (a teaching session, or the author's personal notes) and reported findings: propositions and
their reasoning chains. You NEVER see the source itself — the extractor is fully trusted, and you do not re-check
its work. Your job is IDENTITY: connecting those findings to the CURRENT knowledge graph, preparing the merge.

You explore the graph through your tools: list_sessions, list_propositions, and find (glob over names +
statements + aliases; each hit also says which session it was born in). The graph is SMALL and FINITE — a handful of
sessions — and your job is done as soon as you have SEEN the plausible candidates. FOLLOW THIS PROCEDURE:

1. GROUND yourself first: call list_sessions ONCE. This one call shows the entire space — every session that ever
   contributed propositions, and how many. Now you know the extent of what you are searching; nothing is hidden.
2. READ the plausibly-related sessions: for each session whose topic could overlap these findings, call
   list_propositions — every proposition born there, with full statement text. A few calls and you have read
   every realistic identity candidate in the graph.
3. find is your targeted sweep: use it for phrasings, synonyms, and neighboring ideas the session reads made you
   wonder about — its hits point back at sessions you can read whole.
4. SUBMIT. Once every plausibly-related session has been read (and stray finds come back empty), you are DONE.
   Do not re-search ground you have already seen; more patterns over the same nodes are wasted work.

IDENTITY — links, per proposition:
- For each proposition: does an EXISTING node — one you have now SEEN — already state this same proposition?
- If yes: add { "id": <its proposition id>, "linkTo": <that node's id> } to "links". The session's phrasings join
  its aliases and its provenance; the node keeps its existing name.
- If no: add nothing — a new node is created with the extractor's name as its label.
- EQUIVALENCE BIAS (owner ruling): paraphrases, rewordings, and compressions of the same claim MERGE. When two
  statements are the same claim at different precision or from different angles, LINK them. Only genuinely distinct
  propositions — different claims about the world — stay apart. You are NOT guarding against wrong merges; you are
  hunting for right ones.

Your deliverable is ONLY the identity verdicts: "links". NEVER restate the propositions —
the merger already has them. You NEVER create relations between propositions — they come from the
extractor alone, and the batch connects to the existing graph ONLY through the equivalences you identify. Your
entire deliverable is ONE submit_review call.

Include the "links" field even when empty — "links": [] when nothing links. NEVER omit it because it is empty.`;
