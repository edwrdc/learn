 * (single process, no stale-client hazard to defend against at this seam).
 * Schema-version lazy migration happens inside readSettings, never in
 * the callers. (The legacy default-settings.json fold died with the chat
 * section — per-session models, owner 2026-09-28.)

 * layout (config.PROMPTS_OVERRIDE_DIR). File presence is NOT the override:
 * the settings record's agent.prompts switch is the explicit on/off, so a
 * user can keep a customized file on disk while running the source default.
 * The segment LIST is always derived from source at runtime — see the
 * adapter (src/store/prompt-overrides.ts) for the loader rules.

 * too (src/server/keys.ts). Unknown vars ride along verbatim.
